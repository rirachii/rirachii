          Thank you for taking the time to view my webpage. My name is Michelle Weng, and I am currently a Senior studying computer science. With a strong interest in web development and cloud services, I am constantly seeking out new opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge.
        
        <p>
          I had the privilege of participating in the summer '22 REU research program at UB, where I worked on the Industrial Metaverse System. This IoT system utilized sensors to track information on industrial machines, such as CNC machines and 3D printers. As the lead developer for the front-end design and development of the web User Interface in React, I was responsible for displaying real-time sensor data to users.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also had participated in JPMorgan code for good hackathon where my team won first place in our respective category and will be interning there over Summer '23.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're looking to talk about experiences, education, connect about an opportunity, feel free to send me an email!
